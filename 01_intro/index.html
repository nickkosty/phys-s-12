<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class="margin"></p>
My 3 best ideas for my final project.
<p class="margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1: Focus Stone</h4>
<p class="margin"></p>
Just thinking about making a little stone you can tap to start focus sessions. No screen, just a super simple timer that maybe connects to Toggl or something. Would be nice to have something physical, not another app. Feels like something that could help with focus without feeling like more tech.

<p class="margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 2: E-Ink To-Do List</h4>
<p class="margin"></p>
Maybe like an Ugmonk Analog but with an e-ink screen instead of cards. Could update tasks right on it, so you don’t need to buy more cards. Just a clean little thing for the desk, I’d probably use it myself. Feels like a nice way to track tasks without more paper.

<p class="margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 3: Shopify Sales Display</h4>
<p class="margin"></p>
Could be cool to make a little desk display that shows live Shopify sales. Something simple that just pings when you get an order. Would be fun to have on the desk, kind of like a little motivation boost. Could just pull from the Shopify API every few seconds.
